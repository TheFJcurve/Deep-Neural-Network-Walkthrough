# DeepLearningWithPython
 While going through the textbook, I noticed that some codes were not functioning. So I have corrected and implemented them here. As I get more advanced in the field, I will create a guide for begineers to understand the concepts of deep learning.

 CURRENT UPDATE: The codes are up to Part 1 Chapter 3 level. They have my own annotations as simple understandings. They are the most basic regression and classification problems.
 
 If you wish to learn the mathematics behind deep learning, I highly recommend 3Blue1Brown's neural network playlist after a readthrough of the first two chapters.
